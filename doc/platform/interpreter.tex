\secrel{SomeScript interpreter}\secdown

Platform includes programming language interpreter (script engine) with

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item 
pythonic syntax
  \item 
AST-based interpretation without bytecode
  \item 
reflection in-kernel support for program autogeneration and transformation (some
sort of homoiconicity)
  \item 
parallel and distributed computing elements: multitasking and synchronization,
dataflow programming, cloud management.
  \item 
knowledge database specific functions: graph processing, logic programming and
inference
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
SomeScript was designed as language with deep reflection and program
transformation support, so compiling source code or intermediate AST into
bytecode is waste step.
